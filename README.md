# Data Visualization Project
Project submission for the Udacity Data Visualization course.

## Summary
This data visualization shows the number of flight cancellations between 1988 and 2008 for all domestic U.S. flights. The full data set can be found [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html).

## Design and Feedback
The design started with a simple scatterplot of the number of cancellations per year. With the basic scaling and functionality finished, the dataset was expanded to be able to show the per month and per day numbers. Buttons were added to allow the reader to choose the view of the data that they wanted. The last addition was functionality to view the data segments by the year.

### Feedback: gist Revision 5
The reader noticed that there were spikes in the visualization that occurred at the beginning of every year. The reader guessed that these spikes of cancellations had to do with winter weather. With that in mind, the viewer suggested adding an option for showing the cancellations based on the departure airport and destination airport.
